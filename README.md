# Hack Together: The AI Chat App Hack

![# Hack Together: The AI Chat App Hack](./media/Python%20Hack%20Banner%202.png)


## Introduction

üõ†Ô∏è Build, innovate, and **#HackTogether**!üõ†Ô∏è It's time to get started building your first AI Chat App, using the power of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). ü§ñ + üìö = üî•

GPT models are powerful language generators, but they don't know everything about the world. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines the power of GPT with the knowledge of a search engine. This allows you to ask questions of your own data, and get answers that are relevant to the context of your question. We'll show you how to build a RAG Chat App using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Python, and extend it for your own data sources.

Hack Together is your playground for coding and experimenting with RAG Chat Apps. With mentorship from Microsoft experts and access to the latest tech, you will learn how to build apps using the most exciting technology - LLMs and vector search databases! The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! ü•≥

The hackathon starts on **January 29th**  and ends on **February 12th**. It is recommended for participants to follow the Hack Together Roadmap for a successful hackathon.

## Hack Together Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## Judging and Prizes üèÜ

Projects will be evaluated by a panel of judges, including Microsoft engineers, product managers, and developer advocates. Judging criteria will include innovation, impact, technical usability, and alignment with corresponding hackathon category.

Each winning team in the categories below will receive a cash price of $500. üí∏

* **Best overall**: The best app will combine both a compelling data source and significant refinements to the RAG flow to improve the user experience and LLM answer quality.
<!-- * **Best use of GPT-4-vision**: Showcase how LLMs can help answer questions about image-heavy data sources.-->
* **Best data source**: Bring in a data source that makes for such a compelling chat that we wonder how we ever survived without it.
* **Best in your own language**: Show us a RAG Chat App that uses non-English data sources. Bonus points for documenting any improvements you had to make to improve search and LLM performance for your app's language.
<!-- * **Best open-source contribution**: Submit a pull request that improves the [primary repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/). Consider which issues are already filed and which changes are generally helpful for all RAG chat apps. We will not necessarily merge all pull requests, but we love to see contributions.-->
* **Most helpful community member**: We're looking for hackers that are super engaged in the streams, answering other participant's questions in the forums and issue trackers, contributing code improvements, and are generally bringing good vibes to our Hack Together. ü•∞

**üèÖ All hackathon participants who submit an app will receive a digital badge.**
